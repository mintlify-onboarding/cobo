## What do `coin`, `display_code`, and `description` separately mean in the interface?

`coin` is Cobo’s internal coin code, which uniquely identifies each coin, while `display_code` is the ticker symbol of a coin (not unique, changeable, for reference only ). `description` indicates the full name of a coin (not unique, changeable, for reference only ).For example: Tron was an ERC-20 token before launching its own mainnet and token. The ERC-20 and Tron mainnet tokens would share the same `display_code` and `description`, but have different `coin` values.

## What do `amount` and `abs_amount` mean in the interface?

In the cryptocurrency world, each coin has a smallest unit. For example, Bitcoin’s smallest unit is Satoshi; 1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi. Cobo expresses amounts in terms of the smallest unit of the coin. This is to avoid problems caused by the misuse of floating numbers. Therefore, when transferring 1 BTC, the amount in the transaction is 100,000,000. In other words, `abs_amount` is used to indicate the same thing in real numbers. Clients may configure according to their own preferences. The conversion relation between them is: **abs_amount = amount / pow(10, decimal)**
